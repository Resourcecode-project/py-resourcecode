Estimate of Weather Window for marine operations, based on significant wave height
==================================================================================

The objective is to provide the probability of occurrence and expected mean
number of events of weather windows corresponding to situations when :math:`Hs`
remains below an access threshold (:math:`Ha`) for a given duration :math:`T`.
Associated operational parameters are the access time and waiting time. Because
of the seasonal variability of the wave climate, Weather Windows parameters are
estimated over monthly periods. The implemented method is based on results
presented in:

- EQUIMAR Deliverable D7.4.1 «Procedures for Estimating Site Accessibility and
  Appraisal of Implications of Site Accessibility » (2010), T. Stallard,
  University of Manchester, UKJ-F. Dhedin, Sylvain Saviot and Carlos Noguera
  Électricité de France, France)

  and Tidal Energy Conference, Southampton, EWTEC2011.
