    Parameters
    ----------
    filename_or_obj: str, Path, file-like
        Strings and Path objects are interpreted as a path to a netCDF file
        or an OpenDAP URL and opened with python-netCDF4, unless the filename
        ends with .gz, in which case the file is gunzipped and opened with
        scipy.io.netcdf (only netCDF3 supported). Byte-strings or file-like
        objects are opened by scipy.io.netcdf (netCDF3) or h5py (netCDF4/HDF).

    -------
    dataframe: pd.DataFrame
        The newly created dataset.

    Notes
    -----
    `read_netcdf` is a simple helper to load netcdf files. Please refer to
    :py:func:`xarray.open_dataset` for more parameters if needs be.
