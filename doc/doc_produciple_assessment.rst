Producible Assessment
=====================

Introduction
------------

This toolbox estimates WEC energy production using the ResourceCode wave data as an input
and capture width data to simulate the behaviour of the considered WEC. The tool comes
with a built-in case study based on the generic two-body heaving converter presented
in [Babarit2012]_. It should be emphasised that for practical reasons, this tool
cannot be too computationally intensive and the underlying modelling is therefore associated with significant
assumptions. The energy production estimates generated by this tool are therefore only indicative and should
be considered with caution.

Underlying model
----------------

The case study is modelled using linear boundary element method in the frequency domain.
More on the model itself can be found in [Babarit et al., 2012]_. The PTO strategy is pure linear damping.
Capture width curves are established using the frequency domain model over the frequency range covered by
the RESOURCECODE database for 20 different values of damping coefficients (ranging from 500 to 16000 kN.s/m).
For every single seastate considered, a brute force optimisation is carried out to work out the best damping setting.
In other words, for every hourly seastate considered, the 20 different damping values are tried and the one yielding
the highest energy production is considered optimum.

In an attempt to take into consideration the nonlinearities, which reduces power production in the most energetic
seastates, but cannot be accounted for by the linear model, a correction factor based on wave steepness has been
introduced. More details on this factor and on the way it is implemented can be found in
section F of [Pascal2019]_.
