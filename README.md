# Resourcecode library


## Installation

To install the library, you may first of all, create a dedicated virtual
environment:

```shell
$ cd /your/work/directory
$ python3 -m venv env-resourcecode
```

then, you activate it:

```shell
$ source env-resourcecode/bin/activate
(env-resourcecode)$
```

In this virtual environment, you can now install the library. The library is not
available on PyPI yet, therefore you have to download the archive
([here](https://forge.extranet.logilab.fr/ifremer/resourcecode/-/archive/branch/default/resourcecode-branch-default.zip)
for instance), and then install it:

```
(env-resourcecode)$ python -m pip install /your/downloads/directory/resourcecode-branch-default.zip
[…]
```

To test whether the install has been successful, you can run:

```bash
(env-resourcecode)$ python -c "import resourcecode ; print(resourcecode.__version__)"
0.1.0
```

which should print the current locally installed version of `resourcecode`.


## Configuration

The library needs a configuration file to work properly. This file contains in
particular the URL of the Cassendra API.

The library will look for the configuration at the following location (in the
order) :

* in the file described by the `RESOURCECODE_CONFIG_FILEPATH` environment
  variable.
* in a file named `resourcecode.ini` in the current directory.
* in a file located in `$HOME/.config/resourcecode.ini`.
* in a file located in `/usr/local/etc/resourcecode/config.ini`

The search stops at the first file found.

The default configuration file can be found [here](./config/config.ini). You may
download it and move it to this location: `$HOME/.config/resourcecode.ini`.

You may need to update the Cassandra URL.

## Example of use

Once the library is installed and the configuration is done, you can use the
library.

The first thing to do, is a create a `Client`. The client will query the
cassandra database for you, and return a pandas dataframe of your selection.

See the following example:

```ipython
>>> import resourcecode
>>> client = resourcecode.Client()
>>> data = client.get_dataframe_from_criteria(
"""

    "parameter": ["fp", "hs"]
}
""")
>>> data

>>> # if you have malptolib installed, you can do the following
>>> ax = data.plot()
>>> ax.figure.savefig('fp_hs.png')
```

which will generate the following plot:
