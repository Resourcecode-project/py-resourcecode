  abstract     = {{"Resource mapping is essential for the optimal planning of the deployment of Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) converters. A proper characterization of the environmental forcing enables optimization of energy extraction and a more accurate assessment of the structural loading, hence contributing to ensuring reliability and survivability of devices at a given production site.Providing an adapted characterisation of the environmental loading requires availability of relevant datasets, either obtained from measurement, in-situ or remote, or from modelling as well as the adapted data analysis tools and procedures allowing for a better description of the underlying physics.ResourceCODE provides a full suite of tools to support ocean energy analytics, elaborated to underpin design and operational decisions for ORE deployments, associated with a comprehensive hindcast database of high-resolution ocean energy resource parameters for European waters.The configuration of the ResourceCODE model is based on a high-resolution unstructured grid extending from the south of Spain to the Faeroe Islands and from the western Irish continental shelf to the Baltic Sea. Forcing winds are extracted from the ERA5 database while the currents and water levels are recomposed from a database of harmonics of tidal currents (MARS and FES2014).Running WaveWatch III® using this configuration, a 28-year metocean database covering the [1993-2020] period with an hourly time step was produced. A set of 39 global parameters as well as the frequency spectra are made available as output at each of the 328 000 nodes of the grid while directional spectra are made available on a coarser grid.The model configuration and dataset have been extensively validated against measurement data, both in-situ and remote. Special consideration was given to the assessment of the spectral distribution of the energy within sea-states spectra.The associated ResourceCODE Marine Data Toolbox provides an advanced suite of tools to support ocean energy analytics. In addition to the basic time series descriptive statistics, this toolbox provides developers with a set of standard functions for resource assessment and operations planning, including a capacity for comparison with collocated in-situ measurement datasets. A set of advanced statistical modelling tools enables the capacity for developers to conduct the assessment necessary to reduce uncertainty in expected environmental conditions and de-risk investment in future technology design.The opensource services offered in the ResourceCODE Marine Data Toolbox will be accessed through an online platform, specifically designed to facilitate for users - test facilities, the supply chain and renewable technologies developers undertaking pre-commercial demonstration (TRL4 to TRL 8) - data access and processing as well as output visualisation and storage.Hence, the ResourceCODE Marine Data Toolbox will provide reliable traceable validated data to support the ORE industry in contributing to reducing design and development cost."}},

  abstract = {Design optimization is crucial as offshore structures are exposed to deeper and harsher marine conditions. The structure behaviour is dependent on several joint environmental parameters (wind, wave, currents, etc.). Environmental contours are useful representations to provide multivariate design conditions. However, these contours may lead to different design points depending on the method used to compute them, and thus may be misleading to structural engineer. In this work, we propose to use a response meta-model for the inter-comparison of some state-of-the-art methods available for modelling multivariate extremes, in order to provide a straightforward methodology, focusing on the derivation of three-dimensional contours. The considered case study focuses on the tension in a mooring line of a semi-submersible platform. In a first step, the key met-ocean parameters and the associated load model of the tension in the mooring line are set-up. Several multivariate extreme analysis methods are then applied to derive the environmental contours. These methods are chosen in order to cover all the possible dependence cases, from extremal dependence to extremal independence. Conditional Extreme and several extreme value dependence function models are investigated. The physical-space Huseby contouring method is used to derive environmental surface. A comparison with the extreme load extrapolated from the meta-model is provided to assess the performance of each method.},

  abstract     = {{"Renewable energy production through wave energy is still a developing technology as most of the full-scale wave energy converter (WEC) currently deployed are prototypes. One of the key performance aspects of a WEC concept that needs to be assessed, throughout its development cycle to ensure commercial viability is its associated cost of energy. In turn, one of the main element underpinning cost of energy calculations is the assessment of energy production. It relies on the combination of two fundamental building blocks: the estimation of the wave resource at the potential deployment site and the characterisation of the performance of the WEC in that wave resource. In the early stage of a WEC development, the latter typically consists of numerical modelling and/or of scale model tank testing experimental measurements. Wave resource assessment can be obtained from hindcast numerical model or from in situ measurements. This study investigates the impact of the level of details used in describing the wave resource on a WEC energy production estimates. The WEC considered is a generic version of the device developed by the now defunct company wavebob. It is a free-floating, self-referenced device consisting of two floating bodies moving with respect to each other along a vertical axis. It is considered omnidirectional. The behaviour of the system is simulated using a state of the art boundary element method numerical model run in time domain. The hydrodynamics interactions between the fluid and the bodies are based on linear potential flow theory but nonlinearities associated with viscous effects and power take-off (PTO) end-stops are taken into account. The description of the resource used in this study is the hindcast database ResourceCode which is currently being developed within a EU H2020 Ocean Energy ERA-NET project. Once completed, the database will be open access and will provide hourly directional wave spectra at over 24000 locations from the South of Portugal to Norway, over the 1993 to 2020 period. Energy production estimates are first generated using omnidirectional spectral data from ResourceCode as an input to the WEC numerical model simulations. Given that the model is time domain, it requires a wave elevation timeseries which is derived from the ResourceCode spectra. Sensitivity analysis are carried out to investigate the impact of simulation duration on the variability of the energy production estimates. The device power take-off damping is optimised for each sea-state. The ResourceCode omnidirectional spectra are then “downgraded” to scatter diagrams characterising seastates with only the significant wave height and the energy period. Each “downgraded” seastate description is used to generate a wave elevation timeseries assuming a JONSWAP spectral shape which is, in turn used as an input for the WEC numerical simulation. This latter approach is commonly used by developers to assess the potential of WEC concepts, especially at an early stage of development. However, when comparing energy production estimates using the two methods, in some cases, the scatter diagram approach can lead to significant error compared with retaining full spectral information."}},

abstract = {In order to fully utilise test sites, marine energy device developers must be able to deploy, maintain and decommission their equipment in a timely and cost effective manner. In addition, the marine energy industry is moving towards array deployments (DECC, 2012 and BBC, 2012) and whilst these deployments present an excellent opportunity to maximise resource usage whilst minimising the associated costs, for example of deployment, it is essential that said deployment is performed in a cost effective manner. Critical to this is the knowledge of the metocean conditions at the site and the weather window availability, particularly when this is coupled with vessel availability and downtime costs. In this paper a method is presented based on a Weibull model which uses cumulative distributions of the mean duration of persistence of exceedance (Stallard et al., 2010, Walker et al., 2011a). The method discussed has been applied in a case study for the South West of England using site specific environmental parameters and empirical expressions to calculate the accessible periods. The outcomes from the case study are applied to identify the accessible periods and the waiting time for marine operations, and a discussion is made regarding the installation of wave energy devices at the south west Wave Hub (Wave Hub, 2010).}
